# MSPRobot

This repository includes the code for a robot built with the [TI MSP432 microcontroller board](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/texas-instruments/MSP-EXP432P401R/5170609), the [SimpleLink CC3100 WiFi board](https://www.ti.com/product/CC3100), and the [TI-RSLK MAX Robotics kit](https://university.ti.com/programs/RSLK/).

The robot uses the MQTT protocol to receive instructions that allow it to be remotely controlled. In addition, the robot also has an air quality sensor and a temperature sensor, and the robot also reports the sensor data back to the user.

The code for the robot can be found in the `MSPRobot.ino` file.
